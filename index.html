						<h2>the university's largest department needs a new look</h2>
						<span></span>
						<h3>nov 2018 - present</h3>
					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>the problem</h2>
						<p>my manager and i supported 23+ websites for the department of medicine, all on an antiquated and bloated drupal 7 web framework – a framework slated to reach its end-of-life.</p>
						<h2>the goal</h2>
						<p>design an entirely new and original web framework to meet the needs of all users and stakeholders. the end result needs to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>greatly improve on functionality for users and content editors</li>
							<li>modernize the ux & ui to resolve pain points and enhance the web/mobile experience</li>
							<li>operate on the new drupal 8 system</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

							<img src="images/now2-home.png" alt="original template 2 screenshot">
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>issues with the original templates</h2>
						<p>the original templates had remained unchanged for years. some of the main <b>ui/visual</b> problems were:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>an outdated design based on an older parent theme</li>
							<li>super thick navbar and purple bar</li>
							<li>weak/no visual hierarchy</li>
							<li>contrast & spacing issues</li>
						</ul>
						<p>additionally, there were <b>ux/functionality</b> problems:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>confusing dropdown menu</li>
							<li>rigid structure that couldn't be changed by editors</li>
							<li>limited options for highlighting information</li>
							<li>loss of functionality on mobile</li>
						</ul>

					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>rounded corners</h2>
						<p>with the original templates, the department's identity felt like an afterthought, and its content was somewhat unorganized. utilizing rounded corners and a more "card-centric" design, i was able to give a more unique look and feel to the department aesthetic, all the while organizing content in a more concise and digestible manner.</p>
						<h2>menus</h2>
						<p>with the new templates, clients have the ability to choose between a tucked-away menu and a more traditional inline menu – both of which solve ux issues with the original dropdown menu</p>

						</div>
					</div>


					<div class="body">
						<h2>internal pages</h2>
						<p>the original templates were not 'scan friendly.' because users scan websites for the information they're looking for, i designed a <b>page outline section</b> (located on the left, in a 'fixed' position) that allows readers to quickly jump to the information they're looking for.</p>
						<p>in addition, with the absence of a sidebar and the clear visual separation of content above/below the fold, my design encourages editors to be more intentional with content placement and order.</p>

						<h2>exciting medical news stories are waiting to be shared</h2>
						<span></span>
						<h3>jan 2019 - present</h3>
					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>the problem</h2>
						<p>department news stories were scattered everywhere, with no single website to live on. i suggested a conglomerate news site for our department and its divisions, and leadership loved the idea.</p>
						<h2>the goal</h2>
						<p>design a news site that would act as the go-to for all things news – both for the department and for the public. the end result needed to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>be designed to tell news stories in an engaging way</li>
							<li>be able to work with minimal (or even poor quality) media</li>
							<li>encourage internal and external audiences to share news</li>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>turning restrictions into opportunities</h2>
						<p>i moved forward with the above 'card' design because it worked well with the small images that would often accompany news stories (the department did not have access to a regular photographer).</p>
						<p>in addition, it was important to create a similar aesthetic to that of the <b>web framework redesign</b> (case study #1) to give the department's brand identity a sense of thematic consistency.</p>
						<h2>homepage options</h2>
						<p>i decided on a multi-option homepage layout to give news stories different 'tones.' as a result, a single story could be presented in a few different ways, depending on the tone the author wanted to convey.</p>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>vertical content, horizontal menu</h2>
						<p>with the focus of the news site being, well, <b>news</b>, i kept the top of each page free from getting bogged down with links. in order to do so, i tucked the sparse navigation off and away to the side, with the focus being more on the content and vertical nature of the ui.</p>
						<p>my design moves the eye in a vertical motion, much like what inspired it: newspapers and magazines.</p>

						<h2>building a new website for an important research center</h2>
						<span></span>
						<h3>oct 2018 - feb 2019</h3>
					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>the problem</h2>
						<p>the center for emerging & re-emerging infectious diseases (long names tend to be common in the medical field) was looking to create a new website after years of using a very stagnant and sluggish site.</p>
						<p>i had just started with the department of medicine at this point, and the template options we offered at the time were incredibly limiting.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="mobile">
						<div>
							<h3>old homepage (mobile)</h3>
							<img src="images/cerid-old-mobile.png" alt="old cerid mobile screenshot">

						<div>
							<h3>old homepage (desktop)</h3>
							<img src="images/cerid-old.png" alt="old cerid desktop screenshot">
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>the goal</h2>
						<p>as the new designer/developer, i wanted to give the center team more than the two very simple template options that the framework had to offer.</p>
						<p>as shown in case study #1, the two original templates were the following:</p>
					</div>

					<div class="half">
						<div>
							<h3>template 1</h3>
							<img src="images/now1-home.png" alt="old template 1 screenshot">
						</div>
						<span></span>
						<div>
							<h3>template 2</h3>
							<img src="images/now2-home.png" alt="old template 2 screenshot">
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>temporary templates</h2>
						<p>the framework at this point was hosting around 14 websites with just 2 template options. as a result, every website looked incredibly similar to every other website.</p>
						<p>the biggest issue with this was not that the template options were plain (although that didn't help), but that no one site looked different from another. this resulted in confused users; they would often navigate to an entirely different website without knowing it.</p>
						<h2>a third template is born</h2>
						<p>after toying around with different design ideas and user stories, i very quickly came up with a template design option that could be built in a month (our timeline was tight). the new template was:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>a modern take on the base template look (as modern as possible within the constraints)</li>
							<li>a design that incorporated the "uw" aesthetic that was more popular at the time</li>
							<li>something the clients could actually get excited about</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>cerid's new homepage (using the new 'template 3')</h3>

						<h2>closing thoughts</h2>
						<p>the cerid team was incredibly happy with their new website. before we came along, they had little control over their website and visuals.</p>
						<p>'template 3' was a hit, and as you can see with <b>case study #4</b> (department of medicine division sites), we continued to use 'template 3' for the many division projects to come.</p>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>a quick history lesson on the department</h2>
						<p>the department of medicine has 13 divisions, and about half of said divisions' websites were on the web framework when i started this position. the remaining websites not on the framework were <b>incredibly</b> outdated and difficult to use, often times resulting in a decrease in recruitment numbers.</p>
						<h2>the ongoing goal</h2>
						<p>since day 1, the goal was to bring on the remaining divisions so that the department of medicine could present a more unified and modern web presence to internal/external audiences.</p>
						<p>in my first 6 months of employment, we added 3 division sites. we added 3 more over the course of the next year, pushing the number to 12 total division sites – all the while working on a number of other web projects.</p>
						<h2>before & after</h2>

						<h3>jan 2019 - sept 2019</h3>
					</div>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>how it began</h2>
						<p>like many other departments at the university, obgyn was looking to update their website.</p>
						<p>by this point we had designed and built a large number of division and center sites. word had started going around about our service, and once the department of obgyn caught wind, they reached out to us for help.</p>
						<h2>the goal</h2>
						<p>design and build a new site with obgyn leadership while migrating content over from their existing site. the finished site needed to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>organize content in a more efficient manner</li>
							<li>effectively present information to users and stakeholders</li>
							<li>update the visuals and user interface to be more in-line with main campus</li>

					<div class="body">
						<h2>web woes</h2>
						<p>the original website was full of issues, including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>breaking on mobile devices</li>
							<li>repeated, verbose content</li>
							<li>confusing navigation and information architecture</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>highlighting news items</h2>
						<p>we had an option with our framework templates to turn on a 'hero news item' functionality. this allowed a news item to be highlighted on the homepage, and i worked with obgyn leadership to make sure they displayed their news stories as best they could with this feature.</p>
					</div>

						<h2>what's next</h2>
						<p>obgyn (like all other clients) were brought on to the framework prior to our drupal 8 update. while their current site is a fantastic improvement from the original, the plan is to eventually move them over to drupal 8 with my more current design (case study #1).</p>
						<h2>closing thoughts</h2>
						<p>this was the first project where we brought in money for our department. prior to obgyn, we had no paying clients, but our hard work building and designing so many sites in such little time quite literally payed off.</p>
						<p>obgyn was a joy to work with, and they were just as happy as we were with the finished product.</p>
